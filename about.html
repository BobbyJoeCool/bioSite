        <h2>About Josh</h2>
        <p>
            Josh’s interest in blacksmithing began as a quiet fascination rather than a sudden decision. From a young age, he was
            drawn to creating useful objects rather than simply purchasing them. From an interest in times before manufacturing,
            where everything was crafted by hand, to fantasy worlds where entire civilizations revolved around the forge, Josh
            always felt drawn to the flame of molten steel. That opportunity to try for himself came when he happened across a cheap
            anvil and took the chance and purchased it. Slowly, he built a small, humble forge in his backyard, where he spends a
            lot of his free time, twisting the metal into the shapes he wants.
        </p>
        <p>
            Josh gravitates toward forging practical household items, valuing usefulness over display. For him, the most rewarding
            part of the craft is seeing something he made become part of everyday life. A typical day in the forge follows a steady
            routine: cleaning out the firepot, restocking coal, and lighting the forge. While the fire comes up to temperature, he
            decides whether to continue an existing project or begin something new, letting the rhythm of preparation set the pace
            for the work ahead.
        </p>
        <p>
            He enjoys nearly every stage of the blacksmithing process, from shaping hot steel to refining final details. The
            greatest challenges arise when he pushes himself to try new techniques, especially when making knives, which require
            careful planning and attention to detail. Through blacksmithing, Josh has learned the value of patience and the
            importance of slowing down, as rushing often leads to mistakes. The craft has also deepened his appreciation for
            handmade metalwork, while making him more discerning about quality and pricing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Josh was diagnosed with Asperger’s Syndrome, which is now recognized to be a part of the autism spectrum umbrella, and
            that influences how he approaches the craft. The repetition and focus required in forging can be grounding, and he tends
            to research techniques deeply rather than rely solely on imitation. Autism can cause a person to fixate on details and
            dive deeply into a single topic. Looking ahead, he has no fixed expectations but hopes to continue improving and
            eventually sell more of the pieces he creates.
